The CERN_ThomasLanning folder has all my work in it. It is a C++ simulation of particle collider experiments and a Jupyter notebook analysis.

- The Analysis.ipynb is where the story starts. You will probably want to read it through to understand my detector structure since it is a bit unconventional...
- There are two data folders: data_energy_range and Improved_data
	- the first one is for the not-improved analysis
	- the second one is for the improved analysis
-There are some pictures in the folder: I use these in the jupyter notebook so need them there. 
- There is also some data in the main folder: that is just some exploratory data I use at the start of my notebook

Finally:
The folder Project_improved contains my improved version of the simulation
The folder Project_not_improved is my initial version. 
	- I edited both of the src code after compiling it last, but only with comments so 
	  when you rerun the code, it might recompile for that reason. 

Enjoy :)
